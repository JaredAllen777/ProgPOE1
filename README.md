# ProgPOE
//Welcome to my Recipe project
in this project we focused on taking a users inputof a recipe and all of the ingredients and quantities of the ingredients
the program was made so that a user may write a recipe, enter the ingredients and the amount of ingredients and then either diplay set recipe 
or scale it by the factor of 0.5, 2 or 3. 
When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter the recipe details, it will then ask for the ingredients and the steps
that are needed to be taken to create set dish. once the recipe is fully written, the user is able to either display the recipe with thr program, 
scale it by the factor of 0.5, 2, or 3. the other choices are to clear the quntities of the ingrediants or to either 
clear the recipe as a whole.
